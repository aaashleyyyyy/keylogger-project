# üîç Key Logger Project 

Key Logger is a device which logs every key one has typed. It is often used by hackers and malicious actors 
to get confidential information. (Don't worry...I'm not trying to get any information. I did this project to learn
more about cybersecurity)

## How to run the key logger?

There are antivirus and privacy tools on your computer to detect key loggers so it must be disabled in order 
to run this program.

### Where does it log the keys?

The keys get logged on a txt file.
